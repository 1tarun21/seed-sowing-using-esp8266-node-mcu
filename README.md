# seed-sowing-using-esp8266-node-mcu
This repository contains the code and documentation for our final year engineering project "Smart Seed Sowing System", developed using the ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller. The aim of the project is to automate the seed sowing process in agriculture using IoT, enabling farmers to achieve more precise and efficient farming with minimal manual effort
 Project Overview
The Smart Seed Sowing System leverages the capabilities of the ESP8266 NodeMCU to:

Control a motor-driven seed sowing mechanism.

Ensure consistent seed spacing and depth.

Operate wirelessly via Wi-Fi-based controls or web interface.

Promote automation in agricultural practices to enhance productivity.
